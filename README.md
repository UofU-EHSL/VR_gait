# VR_gait

Required equipment
- SteamVR light house tracking compatible headset
- 2 vive trackers that match the tracking solution (1.0 are the square fronts on the light houses and work with the trackers that have the grey triangle on them, the blue triangle ones only work with the lighthouses that have the rounded glass 2.0)
- 1 tracked controllers that also have to match the tracking solution you have chosen.

Non-requirements but nice to have
- 2 tracked controllers (Makes it so you can see both of your hands, only one is required for setup but every headset comes with 2 so use them)
- A vive wireless adaptor if you are using a vive or vive pro.
- The 2.0 tracking solution. (only works on vive pro, and index headsets but gives a much larger tracked volume)
- A real plank to walk on! If you really wan to take things to the next level and feel the edge of the board on the bottom of your foot you can get a real plank an calibrate to that.

Using unity version 2019.1.2f1

The main scene is Assets > Scenes > GaitExperimentScene.unity

To build the project open it in the right unity version (2019.1.2f1) and then do File -> build settings... make sure the correct scene is in the list and that make sure Windows is the target platform. Then click Build.
